Featuring research from the participants of the themed day from the [Eighth Conference of the School of Mamluk Studies](https://www.egylandscape.org/conferences/07_2022_SMS_Marburg/) hosted at the University of Marburg in July 2022, a proceedings volume edited by Albrecht Fuess and Anthony Quickel will appear in early 2024. This volume will be a part of Peeters’s series “Mémoires de l’Association pour la Promotion de l’Histoire et de l’Archéologie Orientales” which is edited by Frédéric Bauden of the University of Liège and which has hosted other Mamluk conference proceedings. The issue centers on the conference theme — “Environment and Nature in the Mamluk Sultanate” — and will have contributions by nine of the participants in four broad categories: animals; pharmacology and medicine; the plague; and geography and space.
