The final conference of the EGYLandscape Project was organized by project leader Nicolas Michel (Aix-Marseille University) and hosted in Aix-en-Provence. It was a wonderful opportunity for the EGYLandscape team to come together for one last time and share everyone’s work. Because all of the session were shared online, we had project participants meeting together both in person and virtually. The meeting began in the evening of 6 September with a welcome by the project leaders and a keynote lecture by Prof. Nelly Hanna of the American University in Cairo.

The next two days of the conference featured presentations of the findings of the various projects the team had been working on over the past three years. Sessions included: Geoarcheology, Geohistory, and Landscape; Tribes and Bedouins; Economy; Land Status and Fiscality; Animals, Mankind, and Hunting; and Landscape. After the final session, our project research engineer presented the webGIS, which is nearly ready and will be online in the spring of 2023. Albrecht Fuess and Nicolas Michel presented closing remarks for both the conference and the project, and the group gathered for a final reception and project toast.
