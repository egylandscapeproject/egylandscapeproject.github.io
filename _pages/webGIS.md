A core outcome of the EGYLandscape Project is the historical webGIS presented [here](https://egylandscape.mmsh.fr/), allowing an exploration of rural Egypt in pre-modern times. This webGIS combines textual sources, from the late medieval (13th to 15th centuries) and modern (19th to mid-20th century) periods, with cartographic resources available for the last two centuries to georeference the gathered textual information on a map. The medieval textual sources provide for an exhaustive listing of the basic administrative units and specify their administrative status in their time, thus offering a historical gazetteer of Egypt. Still, these entities evolved considerably over time, with frequent appearance of new places or administrative units, disappearance of existing ones, or change in name or status. The webGIS allows the user to dive into the geography of rural Egypt over seven centuries, by merging in a single place all the information across the consulted historical sources and, therefore, time-periods.
